# How to Play Yahtzee
Roll dice for scoring combinations, and get the highest total score.

## Game Summary
On each turn, roll the dice up to 3 times to get the highest scoring combination for one of 13 categories. After you finish rolling, you must place a score or a zero in one of the 13 category boxes on your score card. The game ends when all players have filled in their 13 boxes. Scores are totaled, including any bonus points. The player with the highest total wins.
How to Play Each player takes a score card. To decide who goes first, each player in turn rolls all 5 dice. The player with the highest total goes first. Play then passes to the left.

## Taking A Turn
On your turn, you may roll the dice up to 3 times, although you may stop and score after your first or second roll. 

### First roll: 
Roll all 5 dice. Set any “keepers” aside. You may stop and score now, or roll again.

### Second roll: 
Reroll **ANY** or **ALL** dice you want. You don’t need to
declare which combination you’re rolling for; you may change your mind after any roll. You may stop and score after your second roll, or set aside any “keepers” and roll a third time.

### Third and final roll: 
Reroll **ANY** or **ALL** dice you want. After your third roll, you must fill in a box on your score card with a score or a zero. After you fill in a box, your turn is over.

## Scoring

When you are finished rolling, decide which box to fill in on your score card. For each game, there is a column of 13 boxes. You must fill in a box on each turn; if you can’t (or don’t want to) enter a score, you must enter a zero. Fill in each box only once, in any order, depending on your best scoring option.

The score card is divided into an Upper Section and a Lower Section. Scoring combinations for each section are explained below. 

| Upper Section |  What to Score        | 
| --------------|-----------------------| 
| Aces (Ones}   | Total of Aces only    | 
| Twos          | Total of Twos only    | 
| Threes        | Total of Threes only  | 
| Fours         | Total of Fours only   | 
| Fives         | Total of Fives only   | 
| Sixes         | Total of Sixes only   | 

To score in the Upper Section, add only the dice with the same number and enter the total in the appropriate box. For example, with the dice shown below you could score 9 in the Threes box, 2 in the Twos box or 5 in the Five box.

Your goal in the Upper Section is to score a total of at least 63 points, to earn a 35-point bonus. The bonus points are based on scoring three of each number (Aces through Sixes); however, you may earn the bonus with any combination of scores totaling 63 points or more.
